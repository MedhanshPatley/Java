Assigment -1
    Part1: Implement a menu-driven Java program (like fib or factorial) to implement these input methods in java (command line args, Scanner, BufferedReader, DataInputStream, Console )

   Part2: Implement a simple menu driven calculator in java to implement add, sub, mul, div, sqrt, power, mean, variance. Implement a separate Calculator class to include all related function inside that class. (mean calculation : program reads numbers from the keyboard, summing them in the process until the user enters the string “end”. It then stops input & displays the avg. of numbers)


Assigment -2
    Part1: Write a Java program that declares two arrays named ‘even’ and ‘odd’. Accept numbers from the user and move them to respective arrays depending on whether they are even or odd.
    Part2: Implement a java function that finds 2 neighboring numbers in an array with the smallest distance to each. The function should return the index of the 1st number.
    Part 3: Write a Java program to convert an array into ArrayList and vice versa.
    
  
  Assigment -3
    Write a menu-driven Java Program to study the concepts of classes, array of objects/arraylist, instance members, constructors in java.
Assignment description: Create a Student class describing attributes of a student like prn, name, DoB, marks etc. Create an array of objects of Student class and perform operations like: Add students, Display, Search (by prn, by name, by position), Update/Edit and Delete.
