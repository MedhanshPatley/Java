Assigment -1
    Part1: Implement a menu-driven Java program (like fib or factorial) to implement these input methods in java (command line args, Scanner, BufferedReader, DataInputStream, Console )

   Part2: Implement a simple menu driven calculator in java to implement add, sub, mul, div, sqrt, power, mean, variance. Implement a separate Calculator class to include all related function inside that class. (mean calculation : program reads numbers from the keyboard, summing them in the process until the user enters the string “end”. It then stops input & displays the avg. of numbers)


Assigment -2
    Part1: Write a Java program that declares two arrays named ‘even’ and ‘odd’. Accept numbers from the user and move them to respective arrays depending on whether they are even or odd.
    Part2: Implement a java function that finds 2 neighboring numbers in an array with the smallest distance to each. The function should return the index of the 1st number.
    Part 3: Write a Java program to convert an array into ArrayList and vice versa.
    
  
  Assigment -3
    Write a menu-driven Java Program to study the concepts of classes, array of objects/arraylist, instance members, constructors in java.
Assignment description: Create a Student class describing attributes of a student like prn, name, DoB, marks etc. Create an array of objects of Student class and perform operations like: Add students, Display, Search (by prn, by name, by position), Update/Edit and Delete.  

Assigment-4
    Write a menu-driven Java Program for the following:
There are 52 cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of four suits and one of 13 ranks. Represent a deck of cards as an array of
Objects (*you may use the Vector class)
1.  Use integers to encode the ranks and suits.
2.  Have suitable default & parameterized constructors.
3.  all data members to have private access.
4.  The class ‘Card’ to have the following methods:
createDeck(), printCard(), printDeck (),sameCard(),compareCard(), sortCard(), findCard() which searches through an array or vector of Cards to see whether it contains a certain card, dealCards() function: to print 5 random cards from the existing deck.

Assignment -5
Part -1:
 Implement the generic Shapes class as an interface s so that we can implement concrete classes like circle, triangle, rectangle class from it.
 
 
 Part 2 - In this exercise, take an abstract class which is defined below and develop two classes. The abstract class represents the basic building block for employees in a personnel database. The code is shown below:

abstract class Employee
private String name, address;
protected int basicSalary;


Assignment -6
Part 1: An implementation of IntStack (integer stack) that uses fixed
storage as well as "growable" using interface.

Create a user defined package “pkg_Stack” where the interface is stored.
The other two complete classes will need to import the package
‘pkg_Stack’ and then use it.
Part 2: Program to implement the following Multiple Inheritance.
